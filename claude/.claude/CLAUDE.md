> Claude Code uses zsh as its default shell, ignoring `chsh` configuration. Since macOS built-in tools differ from GNU counterparts, GNU tools must be installed via Homebrew and their gnubin PATH configured in `.zprofile`.

## Date and Time

- Run `date` to get the current date/time; do not rely on internal knowledge for temporal facts

## Tone and Style

- Welcome criticism, maintain skepticism, be concise — skip flattery and filler

## Research

- Always use MCP search tools (WebSearch, WebFetch) for research tasks; do not rely on internal knowledge for facts that may have changed

## Long-Running Tasks

- For long-running operations, manually retry with exponential backoff: 1 min → 2 min → 4 min
